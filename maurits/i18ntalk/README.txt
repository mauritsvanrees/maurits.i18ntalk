Introduction
============

This is a full-blown functional test. The emphasis here is on testing what
the user may input and see, and the system is largely tested as a black box.
We use PloneTestCase to set up this test as well, so we have a full Plone site
to play with. We *can* inspect the state of the portal, e.g. using 
self.portal and self.folder, but it is often frowned upon since you are not
treating the system as a black box. Also, if you, for example, log in or set
roles using calls like self.setRoles(), these are not reflected in the test
browser, which runs as a separate session.

Being a doctest, we can tell a story here.

First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the 
documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()

The following is useful when writing and debugging testbrowser tests. It lets
us see all error messages in the error_log.

    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()

With that in place, we can go to the portal front page and log in. We will
do this using the default user from PloneTestCase:

    >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.setup import portal_owner, default_password

Because add-on themes or products may remove or hide the login portlet, this test will use the login form that comes with plone.  

    >>> browser.open(portal_url + '/login_form')
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = portal_owner
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()

Here, we set the value of the fields on the login form and then simulate a
submit click.  We then ensure that we get the friendly logged-in message:

    >>> "You are now logged in" in browser.contents
    True

Finally, let's return to the front page of our site before continuing

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
